# gitNoms
## Open Source Recipes for Programmers


### About
Living in this pandemic world, more and more people are becoming the home cook. giNoms is an online recipe application. Users can easily upload, edit, or delete their own receipes. gitNoms is built by the Coding Chefs from 4 different time zones!

### The Coding Chefs Team
* Steven Semco
* Collen Whitney
* Woo-Sik Choi
* Anselem Ogbennia

### Technologies Used
* gitNoms was built using the React JavaScript library.  
* For our styling we utilized React Bootstrap.
* Built by hand to give our users the power of our gitNoms API backend.

### Development Story

In our first brainstorming sessions, Woo-Sik Choi came up with the brilliant idea of a recipe application and backend.  We loved the idea and ran with it. Quickly evolving the concept into an "open source" and somewhat "techy" feel to our recipe platform. Our main "milestones" while starting out was a backend and frontend for our application with basic CRUD functionality, we also chose to utilize React Bootstrap to help with some of the styling.

Once the initial vision was realized we hit the ground running.  Our MVP goals were knocked out of the park in the first two days of development.  By spending our days in a Zoom meeting, we were able to overcome the fact that we were all in different time zones, developing our application like we were all in the same room.  This approach led to quicker bug fixes, easier collaboration on components, and ensuring the project stayed close to the initial vision.

Another development first for this team was utilizing a Trello board to organize our workflow and keep everyone on track.  As well as occasionally using pair programming to get the most out of our coding time.

While all of the basic MVP goals were reached, there are still a list of stretch goals we plan to continue adding to the application to really breath life into the project.
